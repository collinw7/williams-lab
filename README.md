<h1>Williams Lab Info Site</h1>
<p>This is a website I created as a project for my ITIS 3135 Web App Design and Development class. The purpose of this website is to serve as an introduction to the hematopathology lab, Williams Lab. The project requirements stated that the site must be developed in vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The project allowed an exception for jQuery as it was covered in the class. I focused my design around modularity so that the client may easily modify the website to include up to date information. The website will be seen by medical and research professionals so I made sure to keep the aesthetic design sleek and simple. I've included below instructions for administrators to make modifications without needing knowledge of web development.</p>
