        <p class="image-2">The <span class="cyan">MBD2</span> and <span class="purple">GATAD2A</span> proteins from the
            NuRD complex form a canonical anti-parallel heterodimeric coiled-coil complex.</p>
    </span>
    <p>Studies have convincingly shown that disrupting MBD2 function restores expression of silenced genes while leading
        to only mild phenotypic changes. Therefore, MBD2 represents an exciting target for restoring expression of
        aberrantly methylated and silenced tumor suppressor genes for cancer as well as developmentally silenced genes
        such as &gamma;-globin to treated inherited β-hemoglobinopathies (i.e. sickle cell anemia and β-thalassemia).

    <br>
    <p>We previously solved the structure of a key coiled-coil interaction between the MBD2 and GATAD2A proteins in NuRD
        and showed that enforced expression of the GATAD2A coiled-coil peptide blocks methylation-dependent gene
        silencing by MBD2.<a class="link ref" target="_blank"

        <p class="image-2">Building on that proof-of-principle experiment, we are developing cell-permeable peptides
            that can inhibit the MBD2-GATAD2A interaction <i>in vitro</i> and intracellularly, as well as the necessary
            assays
            to characterize its function in cells. This molecular probe will provide a powerful new tool to investigate
            the effects of this interaction on complex formation and gene silencing in the chromatin environment of
            cells, and how this MBD2-GATAD2A sub-complex interacts with other components of the intact NuRD.</p>
