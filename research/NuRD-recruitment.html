        <p class="image-2">2D <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectra and circular dichroism measurements of the MBD2 IDR are
            characteristic of a disordered peptide. Analytical ultracentrifugation shows that the region behaves largely
            as a monomer in isolation.</p>
    </span>
    <p>We recently discovered that an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of MBD2 recruits the histone deacetylase
        core complex of NuRD. The IDR between the MBD and coiled-coil domains of MBD2 and is both necessary and
        sufficient to bind the MTA1/2, HDAC1/2, and Rbbp4/7 proteins.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Building on this observation, we are now determining the molecular details of MBD2-NuRD complex formation using a
        combination of FRET/BRET, NMR, and x-ray crystallography.</p>

        <p class="image-2">The NuRD complex can be divided into two functional and physical halves comprising the
            histone deacetylase core and the chromatin remodeling portions. The MBD2 IDR binds and recruits the MTA1/2,
            HDAC1/2, and RBBP4/7 components. The MBD2/3 coiled-coil domain binds GATAD2A/B which in turn binds the large
            CHD4 nucleosome remodeling protein.</p>

            <p class="image-2">We are currently characterizing the structural and physical determinants of binding
                between
                MBD2 IDR and the histone deacetylase core complex. These studies involve a variety of biophysical
                techniques
                <i>in vitro</i> and in cells.
